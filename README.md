- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon McGarvey
- 👀 I’m interested in Microsoft on-premise and cloud systems infrastructure, software development, scripting and databases. I am a systems engineer but in recent years have become interested in software development and databases. I have been teaching myself PowerShell, T-SQL, and more recently C#. I am "curious" of blockchain technology and smart contracts and may eventually dive into learning more on that. I am also a trained musician on piano and percussion and enjoy composing electronic music.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#. I recommend O'Reilly Head First C#: A Learner's Guide to Real-World Programming with C# and .NET Core.
